*Description*
This project involves generating Pascal's Triangle, a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each element of the triangle is the sum of the two elements directly above it. This pattern starts with the number 1 at the top and has a wide range of applications in mathematics and computer science.

*Background*
Pascal's Triangle is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, though it was known to mathematicians in India, China, and Iran well before his time. It is used in algebra, combinatorics, and number theory, among other fields.

*Requirements*
Python 3.x
Basic understanding of Python programming
Familiarity with combinatorial mathematics (optional but helpful)

*Usage*
To generate Pascal's Triangle, you need to specify the number of rows. The script will output the triangle as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row.
